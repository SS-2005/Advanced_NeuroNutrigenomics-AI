For depression, this involves PHQ-9 evaluation and analysis of specific genetic markers like 5-HTTLPR and BDNF variants; for bipolar disorders, mood episode history and circadian gene analysis take priority; while anxiety disorders require careful assessment of avoidance behaviors alongside serotonin transporter gene variants. This multilayered diagnostic approach ensures accurate differentiation between conditions and their subtypes, which is particularly crucial when comorbidities are present.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Following confirmation, the intervention strategy adopts a phased approach that prioritizes the most impairing condition first - typically bipolar disorder when present, followed by major depression, then anxiety disorders. The pharmacological plan is carefully constructed using pharmacogenomic insights to select medications with the highest likelihood of efficacy and tolerability based on the individual's genetic profile. For instance, a patient with Major Depressive Disorder and COMT Met/Met genotype might benefit from noradrenergic agents, while someone with BD-I and ANK3 variants would typically start with lithium. Concurrently, nutrigenomic recommendations are implemented, focusing on correcting biochemical imbalances through targeted supplementation (e.g., omega-3s for inflammation, methylfolate for MTHFR variants) and dietary modifications that support neurotransmitter production and stress response systems.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The psychotherapeutic component combines evidence-based modalities tailored to the specific condition cluster. A patient with Persistent Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety might receive CBT with enhanced social skills training, while someone with BD-II and Panic Disorder would benefit from IPSRT integrated with interoceptive exposure. Lifestyle interventions are precisely calibrated to address the unique pathophysiology of each condition - strict sleep hygiene and social rhythm regulation for bipolar disorders, graded behavioral activation for depression, and systematic exposure practice for anxiety conditions. Regular monitoring incorporates both subjective symptom tracking and objective biomarkers (e.g., cortisol levels, inflammatory markers), with treatment adjustments made through a decision-support algorithm that weighs therapeutic response against genetic predispositions. Throughout the 12-month intervention period, the plan dynamically adapts based on continuous data integration from clinical outcomes, wearable device metrics, and periodic genetic expression analyses, embodying the MindGen AI® vision of truly personalized, predictive, and preventive mental healthcare.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","This methodology emphasizes early intervention through predictive modeling while maintaining robust ethical safeguards for genetic data usage. By simultaneously addressing biological, psychological, and social determinants through genetically-informed modalities, the approach significantly improves upon traditional trial-and-error treatment paradigms. The pathway concludes with a maintenance phase that focuses on relapse prevention through ongoing genetic monitoring and booster sessions, ensuring sustained mental well-being anchored in each individual's unique neurobiological profile."],"metadata":{"id":"pMj17XWAWOT3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def recommended_path(depression_pred, bipolar_pred, anxiety_pred):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Generates a comprehensive, formatted treatment plan report based on predicted mental health conditions.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    #
