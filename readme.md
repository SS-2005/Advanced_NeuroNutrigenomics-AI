## ‚ú® What This Project Does

- **Predicts Mental Health Disorders:**  
  Analyzes user genetic and clinical data to predict the risk of:
  - Depression (with classification into 6 major subtypes)
  - Anxiety (with subtype classification)
  - Bipolar Disorder (with subtype classification)

- **Personalized Recommendations:**  
  After prediction, the system generates a customized recommended intervention path based on the identified condition(s).

- **Downloadable Reports:**  
  Users can download a detailed PDF report summarizing:
  - Prediction results
  - Subtype classification
  - Recommended actions

- **Secure Login System:**  
  Includes a login and authentication mechanism that uses password hashing to protect user credentials.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Input:**
   - User provides genetic data and clinical information via secure upload.
   - The system integrates genetic, clinical, and behavioral data.

2. **Prediction Pipeline:**
   - Advanced AI algorithms analyze biomarkers, genetic variants, and molecular pathways.
   - A predictive model generates risk scores for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.
   - If a condition is detected, the system further classifies it into the specific subtype.

3. **Personalized Path Generation:**
   - Based on the prediction and subtype, a tailored intervention path is generated.
   - Recommendations may include lifestyle strategies, nutritional guidance, and proactive screening plans.

4. **Reporting and Download:**
   - The results and recommendations are compiled into a comprehensive report.
   - A "Download Report" button allows the user to save the report in PDF format.

5. **Secure Access:**
   - The system includes a hashed login mechanism to ensure privacy and confidentiality of user data.
   - All genetic data is handled under strict privacy protocols.

## üîê Security and Ethics

- **Data Privacy:** All user and genetic data is stored securely and encrypted.
- **Consent:** Users must provide explicit consent before analysis.
- **Hashing:** Passwords are never stored in plain text. A hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) secures user credentials.
- **Ethics:** The system is designed to respect user privacy and avoid discrimination.
